			<p>This game is made with <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> (written with Java syntax). </p>
			<p>This is a game testing accuracy and speed of your shots. In order to get the maximum points out of the game, you have to shoot all the targets in 15 seconds before running out of tries. Some targets have animations. You can also check the game statistics displayed at the bottom during the game. </p>
			<p>There are some keyboard controls as you modify the player name and navigate the menu. You can also pause the game and resume later.</p>
			<p>The game incorporated some festive elements and hope to bring more joy </p>
